## Projects
### Bank Member Churn Project with Logistic Regression 
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.
-	Leveraged Python to perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), uncovering key factors driving member attrition and their relationship with the bank.
-	Built a robust logistic regression model to predict potential member churn, enabling timely and proactive intervention strategies.
-	Achieved a measurable reduction in attrition rates by designing targeted promotional campaigns and implementing a cost-effective, actionable retention plan.
