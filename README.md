## Projects
### Bank Member Churn Project with Logistic Regression 
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.
-	Leveraged Python to perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), uncovering key factors driving member attrition and their relationship with the bank.
-	Built a robust logistic regression model to predict potential member churn, enabling timely and proactive intervention strategies.
-	Achieved a measurable reduction in attrition rates by designing targeted promotional campaigns and implementing a cost-effective, actionable retention plan.

### Used Vehicle Market Analysis and automatic dashboard with Tableau
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python to clean and analyze data, uncovering insights such as the relationship between vehicle color and price.
- Developed predictive pricing models using machine learning techniques, including random forest and lasso regression, achieving a 96% accuracy rate.
- Established and executed an interactive Tableau dashboard to provide customers with data-driven recommendations tailored to their preferences and budget.
- Developed regression models in Python to analyze market positioning of car brands, evaluating price-mileage relationships.

### Long-term investment of Tesla 	September 2024 – November 2024
- Conducted fundamental analysis to evaluate Tesla's intrinsic value and fair stock price using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis.
- Performed SWOT analysis to identify Tesla's strengths and assess market trends in the electric vehicle (EV) industry.

### Ride-Share Price Recommendation App 	April 2024 – May 2024
-	Developed a user-friendly recommendation application using Python and Streamlit to compare Uber and Lyft fares for identical rides.
-	Streamlined the decision-making process for users by providing fare comparisons, saving them the effort of manually checking multiple platforms.

### Conventional airline as influenced by low-cost carriers (2000 - 2018)	April 2020 – May 2020
- Utilized the Concentration Ratio (CR4) and Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) to evaluate market competition in the Taiwanese airline industry.
- Conducted regression analysis to examine the impact of low-cost carriers entering the market on conventional airline market share.
- Demonstrated a statistically significant effect of low-cost carriers in disrupting the market dominance of traditional airlines.
